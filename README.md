In banking, financial, and commercial transactions, signatures are extremely significant. 
Each person's signature may be distinctive. Signatures, on the other hand, provide a number
of difficulties because two signatures created by the same individual may appear to be extremely 
identical. Because each signature has unique and significant differences in its feature parts, 
the structural parameters of the signatures, as well as the local variations in signature features,
are used to match a particular signature with the database. Forgery detection systems, which use 
machine learning algorithms and CNN to prevent identity theft in banks and other businesses, are 
a solution to this problem.This programme can be utilised.
